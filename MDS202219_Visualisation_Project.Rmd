DATA DESCRIPTION:
The data set contains the following information about matches played in the IPL from 2008 to 2019 except those abandoned without a ball being bowled:
Teams involved
Venue and City
Toss and Result
Winner and Win margin
Officials involved
Player of the match



```{r echo=FALSE, message=TRUE}
setwd('C:\\Users\\HP\\Downloads\\archive')
library(ggplot2)
data=read.csv('Matches_Data.csv')
```

number of matches played in the IPL from 2008 to 2019 except those abandoned without a ball being bowled

```{r echo=FALSE, message=TRUE}
nrow(data)
```

how the data looks like:
```{r echo=FALSE, message=TRUE}
head(data)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=TRUE}
venue=data.frame(table(unlist(data['city'])))
colnames(venue)[1]='Venues'
venue['Country']=c('UAE','India','India','South Africa','South Africa','South Africa','India','India','India','India','India','UAE','South Africa','South Africa','India','India','India','South Africa','India','South Africa','India','India','India','India','India','South Africa','India','India','India','India','UAE','India')
ggplot(venue,aes(x=Country,y=Freq,fill=Venues)) +
  geom_col()+
  labs(x="Country",y="No. of matches",title='Venues grouped by country')
```
Above is a visual representation of the different venues and the amount of cricket played


```{r echo=FALSE, message=TRUE}
matches_played=data.frame(table(data['season']))
total_matches=matches_played
total_matches['Freq']=c(59,59,60,74,74,76,60,60,60,60,60,60)
abandoned_matches=data.frame(total_matches['season'],total_matches['Freq']-matches_played['Freq'])
matches=data.frame(total_matches['season'],total_matches['Freq'],matches_played['Freq'],abandoned_matches['Freq'])
colnames(matches)=c('season','total','played','abandoned')
ggplot(matches,aes(x=season,y=total,fill=abandoned)) +
  geom_col()+
  labs(x="Season",y="No. of matches",title="Matches played")+
  geom_text(aes(label=played),vjust=-0.3,size=3)+
  ggtitle('Matches played/abandoned by season')
```
The visual shows the no. of matches played or completely abandoned per season


```{r echo=FALSE, message=TRUE}
team_matches=data.frame(table(unlist(append(data['team1'],data['team2']))))
colnames(team_matches)=c('team','played')
team_matches['won']=data.frame(table(unlist(data['winner'])))['Freq'][2:15,]
team_code=c('CSK','DCH','DC','DD','GL','KXIP','KTK','KKR','MI','PW','RR','RPS','RCB','SRH')
team_matches['code']=team_code
team_matches['win%']=team_matches['won']/team_matches['played']
team_matches_reshaped=data.frame(x=team_matches$code,y=c(team_matches$won,team_matches$played-team_matches$won),group=c(rep('won',nrow(team_matches)),rep('lost',nrow(team_matches))),`win%`=team_matches$`win%`)
ggplot(team_matches_reshaped,aes(x=x,y=y,fill=group))+
  geom_col()+
  ggtitle('Proportion of matches won/lost by each team')
```
The visual clearly shows how CSK and MI have been consistent and successful over the years, DC too has a high proportion of success but over a very small sample size. The now defunct teams mostly had a poor record which contributed to the downfall of franchise. Some other teams like KKR, SRH and RR have always been mid-table with occasional titles which is reflected here. And then teams like KXIP and RCB are not too behind either but haven't been able to cross the final hurdle.


```{r echo=FALSE, message=TRUE}
df=data.frame(table(unlist(append(data['umpire1'],data['umpire2']))))
df=df[order(df$Freq,decreasing=TRUE),]
umpires=data.frame('name'=df$Var1,'matches'=df$Freq)[1:20,]
ggplot(umpires,aes(x=name,y=matches,fill=name))+
  geom_col()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))+
  ggtitle('Umpires who have officiated the most')
```
Majority of the umpires are elite panel umpires or have been elite panel umpires at their time. This is important as the level of umpiring goes a long way in contributing to the league's success.


```{r echo=FALSE, message=TRUE}
x=list(data['win_by_runs'])
run_victory=data.frame(table(factor(cut(unlist(x), breaks=seq(0,150,10)))))
ggplot(run_victory,aes(x=Var1,y=Freq,fill=Freq))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(x='Run margin',y='No. of occurences')+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))+
  geom_text(aes(label=Freq),vjust=-0.3,size=3)+
  ggtitle('Victories batting first')
```
Almost 50% of the victories batting first have been under 20 runs which shows the league's cut throat competition.


```{r echo=FALSE, message=TRUE}
wicket_victory=data.frame(table(unlist(data['win_by_wickets'])))[2:11,]
ggplot(wicket_victory,aes(x=Var1,y=Freq,fill=Freq))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(x='Wicket margin',y='No. of occurences')+
  geom_text(aes(label=Freq),vjust=-0.3,size=3)+
  ggtitle('Victories batting second')
```
To the eye, it appears almost normally distributed which is manifested in the fact that good run chases are usually completed with 5-6 wickets remaining. However, fiery bowling performances usually leave the opponent reeling despite not winning and vice-versa for cold bowling performances.


No. of non-decisive games in regulation time
```{r echo=FALSE, message=TRUE}
nrow(data)-sum(run_victory$Freq)-sum(wicket_victory$Freq)
```

No. of tied matches
```{r echo=FALSE, message=TRUE}
length(data['season'] [data['result']=='tie'])
```


CONCLUSION:
IPL is indeed the most competitive league in the world with all its popularity and diversity. But it is also a launchpad for the youngsters no less.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
